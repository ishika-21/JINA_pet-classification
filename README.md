# JINA_pet-classification
Our ‘Pet Image Classification’ project would help people find information about thier pet in the most brief and concise way. Just upload an image of your pet it to our application and you’ll get all the information regarding their breed, their behaviour, likes and dislikes in just a few seconds.
I belive its important to know about how your pet behaves, what they mean by their gestures to know what they feel. 
This project will help them by giving adequate information they’d need to take their care and enjoy thier time together :)
